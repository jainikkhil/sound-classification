## Introduction
The goal of this project is to build a model that can classify audio samples into different categories. This is achieved by extracting features from the audio files and training a neural network.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the UrbanSound8K dataset, which contains 8,732 labeled sound excerpts (<=4s) of urban sounds from 10 classes.

## Dependencies
To run this project, you need the following libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- librosa
- matplotlib
- tensorflow
- sklearn
- keras

You can install the required dependencies using the following commands:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy librosa matplotlib tensorflow sklearn keras
